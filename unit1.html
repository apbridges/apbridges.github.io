    <h1>I Like Games</h1>
    <h3>My Favorite Video Games</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy playing videos games, whether it be with friends and family, or alone. These are my top three favorite games.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Halo Reach</b>
      </li>
      <ul>
          <li>
            I played this game <i>alot</i> with my friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            This was the only game I played for a whole year.
          </li>
          <li>
            I had a lot of fun making maps in Forge.
      </ul>

      <br></br>
      
      <li>
        <b>Dark Souls</b>
      </li>
      <ul>
          <li>
            I really enjoyed it's aesthetic and that it wasn't a generic fantasy game.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was a challenging game that, even though <i>infuriating</i> at times, was replayable.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's version of storytelling I thought was really well done.
          </li>
      </ul>
      
      <br></br>
      
      <li>
        <b>Minecraft</b>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
            This is the game I probably played most with my Dad.
        </li>
        <li>
            Similarly with Halo Reach, this was the only game I played for a long time.
        </li>
        <li>
            I always found that the game was really relaxing and calming whenever I played it. 
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Games I'm Looking Forward To</h3>
    <p>
      Right now I'm looking forward to two games, <a href= "https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a>. Both of them are sequals to games I have on the list, Dark Souls and Halo Reach respectively.
