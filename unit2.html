        &emsp; &emsp; The Old World consists of the three continents, Europe, Africa, and Asia. They are considered the Old World because during colonial times, the Americas were still predomiantely uncharted. The colonists would dub the Americas the New World with the previously mentioned continents as the Old World, as it was the land from which they came. Here is a short list of continents of the old world including some the countries within them.
